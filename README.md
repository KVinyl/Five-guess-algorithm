Implementation of Donald Knuth's [five-guess algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)#Five-guess_algorithm) for the board game, Mastermind.

In fiveguess.py, the secret code is generated and program solves that code without any input.

In fiveguess_user.py, the secret code is unknown and the user inputs the black and white feedback pegs in order for the program to solve the secret code within five moves.
